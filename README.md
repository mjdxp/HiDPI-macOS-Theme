# HiDPI-macOS-Theme
A HiDPI Xfwm4 theme to mimic macOS. Copy to ~/.themes to select it in your window manager settings.

# Credits
I based this theme off of this theme: https://www.pling.com/s/XFCE/p/2092033
To create the theme, I scaled stuff using GIMP and replaced the buttons with these: https://github.com/lwouis/macos-traffic-light-buttons-as-SVG
